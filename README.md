# 📚 Library Management System (Full-Stack Web Application)

This is a full-stack web application developed as part of a Software Engineering Internship assignment. It allows users to register, log in, and manage a list of books (add, edit, delete, and search). The system is built using ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) for the backend and React + TypeScript for the frontend, with JWT-based authentication and a SQLite database.

- Entity Framework Core (Code First)
- SQLite (local file-based database)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication

### Frontend:
- React (with TypeScript)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- React Router (for client-side routing)
- Plain CSS (no frameworks used)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Please refer to the included `Setup_Instructions.pdf` file in the root directory for full step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run both the backend and frontend locally.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- All backend endpoints were tested using **Insomnia** before frontend integration.
- Frontend functionality was verified using browser tools and manual testing.

---

## 📦 Deployment

This project is currently set up to run entirely on `localhost` for development and testing. To deploy, you may configure environment-specific settings and host the backend and frontend separately.

---

## ✅ Status

This project is complete and stable. All major features have been implemented, tested, and verified.
